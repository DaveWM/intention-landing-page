      The core concept of Intention is that you enter your <i>intentions</i> (i.e. goals or tasks), and link it to other intentions.
      For example, you may want to run a marathon, but you have to get fit first - your intention to run a marathon <i>depends on</i> your intention to get fit. Together, your intentions form a <i>graph</i> - a connected web of intentions.
      Lets walk through how to use the app, which should make it clearer how it works.</p><p class="lead">To start, open up the Intention app at <a href="https://i.ntention.app" target="_blank">https://i.ntention.app</a>. Once you've logged in, you should see a page like this:</p><img src="/images/guide/step-1.png" /><p class="lead">Click "New Intention", which will bring you onto a new page. You're going to create your top-level intention, your ultimate goal, so give it quite a vague title. Fill out the details like so:</p><img src="/images/guide/step-2.png" /><p class="lead">Click save, and you should see a popup saying the intention saved successfully. The page should now look like this:</p><img src="/images/guide/step-3.png" /><p class="lead">Now let's add another intention. I'm going to use the example of running a marathon, but you can substitute another intention if you'd like.
      Click the "Add Sub-Task" button at the bottom of the page.</p><p class="lead">Let's call our new intention "Run a Marathon". Fill out the title, and the page should look like this:</p><img src="/images/guide/step-4.png" /><p class="lead">Notice that "Achieve my Goals" is selected as the <i>parent</i> intention. This means that in order to achieve your goals, you have to run a marathon.
      All intentions, apart from the first one, have to have a parent. </p><p class="lead">Click save, then click "Add Sub-Task". Let's add another intention to "Get fit", which we'll need to do before we can run a marathon.</p><p class="lead">Once you've filled in the form and saved the new intention, the screen should look like this:</p><img src="/images/guide/step-5.png" /><p class="lead">Now we need to add another intention to "Find a local marathon".
       We need to do this in order to run a marathon, but not to get fit.
       Therefore, we want to create another intention with the parent of "Run a Marathon".
       To do this, we can create a "sibling" intention of "Get Fit".
       A "sibling" is an intention with the same parents - in this case, something else we need to do to run a marathon.</p><p class="lead">Click "Add Sibling", then create a new intention called "Buy New Running Gear".
       Once you've done this, navigate back to the home page (you can click on the "Intention" logo to do this).
       You should see a list of the intentions we've created, like this:</p><img src="/images/guide/step-6.png" /><p class="lead">This is nice, but the real power of Intention is in visualising how your intentions fit together.
       Click on the "Graph" tab, and you should see a diagram like this:</p><img src="/images/guide/step-7.png" /><p class="lead">Nice! This is all you need to know to use intention.</p><p class="lead mb-5">Thanks for reading.
